        Computing inspired by the brainâ€™s functions has emerged as the next generation of artificial intelligence. 
        The Nature Conference on Neuromorphic Computing brought together researchers from a wide range of disciplines 
        to discuss the unique challenges and opportunities of this budding field. Various research topics were covered by
        experts, including biological interpretation, software algorithm development, nano-device fabrication, hardware system
        design, and real-time applications.<br>
        
        In this conference, I made a poster presentation entitled as <i>FPGA implementation of spiking neural networks: a case study</i>.
        I investigated the impact of different neuron models on the classification performance of a spiking neural network (SNN). A parallel SNN accelerator
        was implemented on FPGA.
